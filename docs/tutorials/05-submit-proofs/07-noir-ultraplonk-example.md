title: Submit a Noir Ultraplonk Proof
---

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of submitting a Ultraplonk proof generated by [Noir](https://noir-lang.org/docs).

> **Note:** Recursive proofs are not supported.

:::warning
Starting from [bbup v.0.87.0](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/pull/13800) Ultraplonk has been officially deprecated.
To keep submitting Noir proofs via zkVerify, please switch to a previous bbup version.
You can do this via the command:
`bbup -v <version>`
:::

## Requirements

Before starting, ensure you have the [`noir-cli`](https://github.com/zkVerify/ultraplonk_verifier/tree/main/src/bin/noir_cli) tool installed.

  ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/zkVerify/ultraplonk_verifier
    cargo install --features bins --path .
  ```

## Generate a Ultraplonk proof with Noir toolchain

Please, follow the [official Noir documentation](https://noir-lang.org/docs/getting_started/quick_start) to generate a sample proof. At the end of the process you should have two binary files generated by `bb`, namely the proof and vk.

## Convert `proof` and `vk` into zkVerify format
After you obtain the proof and vk from `bb` (let's call them `bb_proof`, and `bb_vk`, respectively), you should convert them using `noir-cli`.

Let's start from the proof (which also contains public inputs). Run the command

```bash
noir-cli proof-data -n <num_public_inputs> --input-proof <bb_proof path> --output-proof <zkv_proof path> --output-pubs <zkv_pubs path>
```

This command will provide the `zkv_proof` and `zkv_pubs` files in binary format. Also the hexadecimal files `zkv_proof.hex`, and `zkv_pubs.hex`are generated, for ease of submission to `zkVerify`.

Then, we convert the vk by running the command

```bash
noir-cli key --input <bb_vk path> --output <zkv_vk path>
```

Also in this case, you should get the `zkv_vk`, and `zkv_vk.hex` files.

To make sure that everything works correctly, run the `noir-cli verify` command by providing the vk, proof, and pubs in binary format:

```bash
noir-cli verify --key <zkv_vk path> --proof <zkv_proof path> --pubs <zkv_pubs path>
```

## Submitting the Proof

1. Head to [polkadot.js.org frontend](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Ftestnet-rpc.zkverify.io#/extrinsics)
2. Select your account (you must have some tVFY).
3. Choose the `settlementUltraplonkPallet`, and the `submitProof` extrinsic.
4. Inside the field `vkOrHash` select `Vk`
5. Fill in all the required fields by copy-pasting them from the hex files obtained in the previous step. You will need to fill the Vk, proof and public inputs. If you have more than one public inputs, you can click on the `Add Item` option to add more public inputs.
6. Enter the Domain ID corresponding to the domain you want to aggregate the proof for. Think of the Domain ID as the target chain for aggregation. You can find a list of available domains [here](../../overview/04-proof-aggregation/05-domain-management.md).

7. Click on the `submitTransaction` button.
