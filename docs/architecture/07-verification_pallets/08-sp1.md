## [`settlementSp1Pallet`](https://github.com/zkVerify/zkVerify/tree/main/verifiers/sp1)

### Statement hash components

- context: `keccak256(b"sp1")`
- vk: `vk`
- pubs: `keccak256(pubs)`

### `Verifier` implementation

The zkVerify SP1 verification pallet supports verifying succinct SP1 proofs. Here we describe the format of proof, verification key, and public values supported by the pallet. A detailed walkthrough of the process of obtaining these artifacts can be found in this [tutorial](/docs/overview/02-getting-started/04-generating-proof.md#sp1-proof).

#### Proof

Proofs should be of the `shrink` type. These proofs can be obtained by invoking the `SP1Prover::shrink` method on a `Compressed` proof.

#### Verification Key

Verification key should be hashed into 8 BabyBear field elements with the `SP1VerifyingKey::hash_babybear`. These field elements should be serialized in little endian format, and concatenated into a 32 byte array.

#### Public Values

Public values are accepted as a vector of bytes.
