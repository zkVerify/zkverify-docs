# zkVerify Mainchain API

Mainchain nodes expose some APIs to provide information about the chain status and endpoints to send commands (e.g. to create a new transaction).

APIs follow the Substrate typical format, and for this reason, they are categorized using the following categories:

- **[Runtime](#runtime)**
- **[JSON-RPC](#json-rpc)**
- **[Constants](#constants)**
- **[Storage](#storage)**
- **[Extrinsics](#extrinsics)**
- **[Events](#events)**
- **[Errors](#errors)**

Also along with our own custom verification pallets, we use the following standard pallets for our chain:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>BABE</td>
    <td>Balances</td>
    <td>Bounties</td>
    <td>ChildBounties</td>
    <td>Claim</td>
    <td>Configuration</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ConvictionVoting</td>
    <td>Coretime</td>
    <td>GRANDPA</td>
    <td>HRMP</td>
    <td>Initializer</td>
    <td>Ismp</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Ismp GRANDPA</td>
    <td>Multisig</td>
    <td>Offences</td>
    <td>Paras</td>
    <td>Preimage</td>
    <td>Proxy</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Referenda</td>
    <td>Registrar</td>
    <td>Scheduler</td>
    <td>Session</td>
    <td>Slots</td>
    <td>Staking</td>
  </tr>

</table>

## [Runtime](#runtime)

Some calls are available to interact directly with the Mainchain runtime.
All the standard calls are available in the [official documentation](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/substrate/runtime).
Availability of these calls may vary depending on the Mainchain runtime configuration and pallet integration.

## [JSON-RPC](#json-rpc)

RPC methods can be used to query the Mainchain node for information or to submit commands.
All the standard calls are available in the [official documentation](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/substrate/rpc).

In addition to these, nodes expose the following custom commands:

### aggregate

#### [aggregate_statementPath](#aggregate_statementpath)

When a [`NewAggregationReceipt`](#newaggregationreceipt) event is emitted the aggregation pointed
by this event is published on the [`Published`](#published) storage. This RPC can be used to get
the Merkle proof of your proof by querying the [`Published`](#published) storage, retrieve the aggregation
and generate the proof:

**Parameters**

- `at`: the block hash where the [`NewAggregationReceipt`](#newaggregationreceipt) event was emitted
- `domainId`: the domain's identifier
- `aggregationId`: the aggregation's identifier
- `statement`: the statement hash of your proof

**Returns**

`MerkleProof`

## [Constants](#constants)

All the standard constants are available in the [official documentation](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/substrate/constants).

## [Storage](#storage)

The node's storage can be queried to retrieve information about the current chain state.
Some endpoints may return also historical data (e.g. the list of validators at a specific block), but availability depends on the specific query and the configuration of the node (e.g. standard vs archive node).
Standard methods are available in the [official documentation](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/substrate/storage).

In addition to them, the following custom methods are available:

### aggregate

#### [nextDomainId](#nextdomainid)

The value of the next valid free domain's identifier.

#### [domains](#domains)

The map from domain identifiers to the domain data.

#### [published](#published)

Contains a vector of tuple `(domainId, Aggregation)` of all aggregations
published in a block. This storage is cleaned **every** new block, that means every
aggregation is present in this storage for **just one block**: the one where it
has been aggregated. In order to create the aggregation proof you should inspect the storage
value at the block where it has been published.

## [Extrinsics](#extrinsics)

Mainchain nodes support some of the most common extrinsics provided by Substrate (see the [official documentation](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/substrate/extrinsics)).

In addition to them, the following custom extrinsics are available:

### aggregate

#### [aggregate](#aggregate_3)

Publish the aggregation. This call is used to publish a new aggregation that is in
the domain both in to be published queue or is still not completed.
If everything is fine, it processes held funds for aggregation and delivery

- `Aggregation`: Compensates the aggregator (the account calling the aggregate extrinsic) for the transaction costs and provides incentive.
- `Delivery`: Pays for the cross-chain dispatch costs to the delivery_owner account

In case everything is fine a [`Event::NewAggregationReceipt`](#newaggregationreceipt) is emitted.
It also dispatches the aggregation to its destination if configured

If the aggregation coordinates are not valid and don't indicate an existing aggregation,
the call will fail, but the weight cost charged to the caller is just the one needed to do the checks.

Restrictions:

- Origin must be authorized according to the domain's `AggregateSecurityRules`
- Domain must exist
- Aggregation must exist and be ready for publication (i.e. an event AggregationComplete mustâ€™ve been emitted)

Arguments:

- `domain_id`: Domain identifier
- `aggregation_id`: Identifier of the aggregation to publish

#### [registerDomain](#registerdomain)

Register a new domain. It holds a deposit to cover the cost of all the storage that the domain needs.
The account that requested this domain will be the owner and is the only one that can unregister it.
[Unregister the domain](#unregisterdomain) will free the held funds and remove the domain from the system.

If everything is fine a [`Event::NewDomain`](#newdomain) is emitted.

Restrictions:

- Origin must be authorized to create domains with the specified delivery destination
  - Regular users (anyone with a signed account) can only register domains with Destination::None
  - Managers can register domains with any destination type
- Delivery owner must be specified (either explicitly or by caller)
- Sufficient funds must be available for the domain storage deposit. Please refer to the runtime config types `AggregateBaseDeposit` and `AggregateByteDeposit`

Arguments:

- `aggregation_size`: Maximum number of statements per aggregation
- `queue_size`: Optional maximum number of pending aggregations (defaults to runtime configuration)
- `aggregate_rules`: Security rules for controlling who can aggregate
- `delivery`: Parameters for delivery (destination and price) At the moment destination can only be either None or Hyperbridge
- `delivery_owner`: The delivery owner, as discussed in the previous section (defaults to origin).

#### [holdDomain](#holddomain)

Hold a domain. Put the domain in `Hold` or `Removable` [state](#domainstatechanged). Only the domain owner can call it.
Once you call this function the domain state could be:

- `Hold`: If there are some aggregations in this domain that are not aggregated yet.
- `Removable`: If the domain is ready to be removed because there are no more aggregations to be aggregated.

Once the domain go in `Hold` or `Removabe` state cannot receive new proofs at all and cannot become in the `Ready`
state again.

**Only when the domain is in `Removable` state** you can call [`unregisterDomain`](#unregisterdomain) extrinsic
to remove it definitely.

The [`DomainStateChanged`](#domainstatechanged) event is emitted when the domain changes its state. This call fails
if the domain is not in `Ready` state or if the caller is not the domain's owner.

Arguments

- `domainId`: The domain's identifier.

#### [unregisterDomain](#unregisterdomain)

Unregister a domain in `Removable` [state](#domainstatechanged). Only the domain owner can call it. All funds that the
domain owner holds on this domain are unlocked.

Arguments

- `domainId`: The domain's identifier.

#### [setDeliveryPrice](#setdeliveryprice)

Updates the delivery price for a domain.
Origin must be domain owner, delivery owner, or manager

Arguments

- `domain_id`: Domain identifier
- `price`: New delivery price

### Verifier Pallets

All verifier pallets share the following interface and define its types for: verification key, proof and public inputs. Anyway the
available extrinsics are:

#### [submitProof](#submitproof)

Submit a `Proof` and verify it against the verification key `Vk` and public inputs `Pubs`. If the proof is valid it'll be included
in the next aggregation within the given domain. The extrinsic fails in the case of an invalid proof.

**Parameters**

- `vkOrHash: VkOrHash` indicates the verification key (the pallet's `Vk`) or the hash (`H256`) of a preregistered one.
- `proof: Proof` the proof to be verified.
- `Pubs: [u8;32]` The byte array representing the public inputs.
- `domainId: Option<u32>` if is not `None` the domain's identifier where aggregating the proof, otherwise the proof is just verified.

#### [registerVk](#registervk)

Register a verification key that can be used later in submit proof calls and emit a `RegisteredVk` event with the verification key hash.

**Parameters**

- `vk: Vk` the verification key that should be registered.
