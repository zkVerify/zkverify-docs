title: Proof Submission Flow
---

The flow will be the following:

1. A proof submitter (rollup / zkApp) submits the proof via the [`submitProof`](./02-mainchain/04-mainchain_api.md#submitproof) extrinsic of the appropriate verification pallet. The proof leaf `value` will be:

   ```rust
   leaf_digest = keccak256(keccak256(verifier_ctx), hash(vk), version_hash(proof), keccak256(public_inputs_bytes))
   ```

   In order to compute the `leaf_digest`, the _statement_, with the previous formula, every verifier should define:

   - `verifier_ctx` (a unique byte sequence)
   - how to hash the verification key
   - how to get the hash version of the verifier to use if any
   - how to extract a byte sequence from public inputs

   Delivery owners must ensure that the delivery price is updated correctly over time.

2. If the proof is valid a [`<VerifierPallet>::ProofVerified`](./02-mainchain/04-mainchain_api.md#proofverified) event that contains the statement value is emitted; otherwise the transaction emits an error.
3. The failing transaction will be included in the block anyway, and the user will pay fees for it. This is to prevent DoS attacks.

### Domain Separated Aggregation

First perform the following checks:

1. If no domain's identifier is provided, do nothing
2. If the pointed domain exists but cannot accept a new proof emits a [`CannotAggregate`](./02-mainchain/04-mainchain_api.md#cannotaggregate) event
3. If the submitter user has not enough funds to pay for his own aggregation cost share, emits again [`CannotAggregate`](./02-mainchain/04-mainchain_api.md#cannotaggregate) event

If all these checks pass then:

1. Hold from submitter's wallet his aggregation cost share
2. Emit [`Aggregate::NewProof`](./02-mainchain/04-mainchain_api.md#newproof) event, containing the digest of the proof `statement`, the domain's identifier `domainId` and the aggregation's identifier in which the proof will be included `aggregationId`.
3. If the current aggregation is complete emits [`Aggregate::AggregationComplete`](./02-mainchain/04-mainchain_api.md#aggregationcomplete) event
4. The Proof Submitter should wait for the[`Aggregate::NewAggregationReceipt`](./02-mainchain/04-mainchain_api.md#newaggregationreceipt) with the `domainId`, `aggregationId`: is important to know the block `B` where this event is emitted.
5. The Proof Submitter can retrieve the Merkle Path of the submitted proof via the [`aggregate_statementPath`](./02-mainchain/04-mainchain_api.md#aggregate_statementpath) RPC call supplying the
   - `at`: the block `B` where the `Aggregate::NewAggregationReceipt` is emitted
   - `domain_id`
   - `aggregation_id`
   - `statement`

## Pallets

Some pallets have been developed to accommodate the requirements:

- **_Verifiers_** where each one defines the proof, verification key and public inputs types, implements the verification logic and defines how to compute the 3 hashes that compose the final statement hash that represents the proof leaf `value`:
  - [**risc0**](./07-verification_pallets/03-risc0.md)
  - [**groth16**](./07-verification_pallets/04-groth16.md)
  - [**ultraplonk**](./07-verification_pallets/05-ultraplonk.md)
  - [**plonky2**](./07-verification_pallets/07-plonky2.md)
  - [**sp1**](./07-verification_pallets/08-sp1.md)
  - [**ultrahonk**](./07-verification_pallets/09-ultrahonk.md)
  - [**ezkl**](./07-verification_pallets/10-ezkl.md)
