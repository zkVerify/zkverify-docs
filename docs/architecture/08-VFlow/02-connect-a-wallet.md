title:  Connect to VFlow
---

To interact with VFlow, you’ll need to connect your wallet (we’ll use MetaMask in this example) and manually add the VFlow network using the provided RPC endpoint and chain details.

## Step 1: Install MetaMask

If you don’t have MetaMask installed yet, download it from the official site, and follow the instructions to set up your wallet.

## Step 2: Add the VFlow Network to MetaMask

Once MetaMask is installed:

1. Open MetaMask and click on the network dropdown (usually says “Ethereum Mainnet” by default).
2. Select “Add network” or “Add network manually”.
3. Fill in the following VFlow network details:

| Field                   | Value                               |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Network Name**        | VFlow                               |
| **RPC URL**             | https://vflow-volta-rpc.zkverify.io       |
| **Chain ID**            | 1409                                |
| **Currency Symbol**     | tVFY (optional)                     |
| **Block Explorer URL**  | https://vflow-testnet.subscan.io/   |

4. Click “Save” to add the network.

You’re now connected to the VFlow chain!


## What’s Next?

Once connected, you can interact with VFlow-based applications, sign transactions, and query data using the VFlow RPC endpoint.
