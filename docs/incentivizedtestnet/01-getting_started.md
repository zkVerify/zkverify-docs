title: Getting started

The original zkVerify Incentivized Testnet concluded successfully in October 2025, with the completion of the final claim event.
All reward distributions linked to the Volta Testnet and the ProofPoints program are now closed.

We are now entering a new phase of the Incentivized Testnet — running directly on mainnet.
While we have kept the name for continuity, this phase no longer operates on a testnet environment.
Instead, participants interact directly with the zkVerify mainchain and can accrue points by contributing to the network in production.

### What This New Phase Is About
The mainnet Incentivized Testnet focuses on supporting the growth of zkVerify by rewarding users who:
- contribute proofs to the network through integrated partners
- help strengthen decentralization by participating in ecosystem activities
- support applications and protocols building on zkVerify
- engage with governance and community-driven processes

Rewards are issued based on on-chain activity and partner-verified contributions, depending on the task category.

### If You Participated in the Previous Testnet
All rewards related to the Volta Testnet and ProofPoints have already been distributed.
- The final claim window opened in October 2025 and closed few months after.
- No further actions are required for past participants.
- Historical data remains available for transparency but is no longer updated.

### How to Participate Now
Participation in this new phase happens directly on mainnet.

You can get started by:
1. Exploring the tasks avaialable at [points.zkverify.io](https://points.zkverify.io)
2. Following the announcements on our website or Discord or X for new tasks and campaigns.

### Why We Still Call It “Incentivized Testnet”
Although the environment is now mainnet, the program continues the mission of the original Incentivized Testnet:
- onboarding new developers
- testing and hardening the proof ecosystem
- rewarding early contributors 
- growing adoption of zkVerify’s verification engine

The name reflects the continuity of the initiative while acknowledging that zkVerify is now fully live.
Remember, this is your chance to be at the forefront of zero-knowledge technology. We can't wait to see what you'll build with zkVerify!
