title: Use the Relayer API - Mainnet
---

### Overview

The Relayer API is a product that makes it easy to verify zero-knowledge proofs using the zkVerify network. This challenge invites you to explore its functionality, submit real proofs, and provide valuable feedback to improve the developer experience.

By completing the tasks below, you can earn Incentivized Program Points and move up the leaderboard.

**Start here**: Read the [Relayer documentation](https://docs.zkverify.io/overview/getting-started/relayer) to understand how the system works.

### Tasks & Rewards

#### 1. Submit Valid Proofs at Scale Using the Relayer API - Mainnet

- Relayer usage is tracked via your Mainnet API key. To use the Relayer API, you will need an API key. Create your API key here: https://relayer-api-mainnet.horizenlabs.io/
- Power users can reach out to us on Discord to adjust their rate limits or fill out this [form](https://forms.gle/8GLNhADGoxkvCdTu7); participants should specify their use cases and/ or apps they’re working on that uses the Relayer integration and we will determine the rate limit increase accordingly.

<i>To earn zkVerify Incentivized Testnet Points, this requires creating a new circuit, registering your verification key, and submitting unique proofs. The proof types we support are: Groth16, UltraHonk, UltraPlonk, Risc0, Plonky2, SP1, Fflonk.</i><br/>

<br />

Points will be calculated based on your valid submission volume over time for qualified use cases. Points will <b><u>not</u></b> be rewarded for submitting the same proof examples provided in the documentations. **To qualify, you must also provide a link to your zk-app that is integrated with the Relayer**
