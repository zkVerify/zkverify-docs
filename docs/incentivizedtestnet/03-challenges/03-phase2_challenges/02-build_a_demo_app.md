title: Integrate zkVerify in your dApp
---

### Overview
Whether you're working on an existing project or starting a new one, we're excited to reward developers who integrate zkVerify's proof verification layer. The challenge is open to all types of applications that use zero-knowledge proofs. 

### Application process
To apply, start by describing your project in detail. Tell us about your dApp, use case, and how it leverages zkVerify's capabilities. 

Finally, submit your proposal using the [provided form](https://forms.gle/Pfs2Hu8YHCwoq6pc7). 

Our team will follow up on Telegram to learn more about your ideas!

<b>Important:</b> points rewards will be granted based on the quality, complexity, and distinctiveness of your submission.

### Coming soon: proof verification program
In the coming weeks, we'll launch an exciting program that rewards the actual usage of zkVerify. The more proofs you submit for verification, the more points you'll earn. This will not only reward active projects but also help us stress-test and optimize our network as we prepare for mainnet.
