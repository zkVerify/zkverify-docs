title: Use the zkVerify Relayer
---

### Overview
The zkVerify Relayer is a tool that makes it easy to verify zero-knowledge proofs using the zkVerify network. This challenge invites you to explore its functionality, submit real proofs, and provide valuable feedback to improve the developer experience.


This is a technical challenge within the zkVerify Incentivized Testnet Phase 2. By completing the tasks below, you can earn zkVerify Incentivized Testnet Points and move up the leaderboard.


**Start here**: Read the [Relayer documentation](https://docs.zkverify.io/overview/getting-started/relayer) to understand how the system works.

### Tasks & Rewards

#### 1. Submit Valid Proofs at Scale Using the Relayer API

* Relayer usage is tracked via your API key. To use the Relayer API, you will need an API key. Contact a zkVerify team member or open a ticket on Discord to request a unique API key. 
* Power users can reach out to us on Discord to adjust their rate limits; participants should specify their use cases and/ or apps they’re working on that uses the ZKVerify integration and we will determine the rate limit increase accordingly.

<i>To earn zkVerify Incentivized Testnet Points, this requires creating a new circuit, registering your verification key, and submitting unique proofs. The proof types we support are: Groth16, UltraPlonk, Risc0, Plonky2, Proof of SQL.</i><br/>

<br />

Points will be calculated based on your valid submission volume over time for qualified use cases. Points will <b><u>not</u></b> be rewarded for submitting the same proof examples provided in the documentations.
