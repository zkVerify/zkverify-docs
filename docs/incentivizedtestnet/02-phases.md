## Phase 2 - Build-to-Earn...more! + Galxe campaign
Following the initial technical Phase 1, we're thrilled to announce Phase 2 of zkVerify's Incentivized Testnet! While our core technical tasks remains almost unchanged, we're now also opening doors to the wider Web3 community.

Phase 2 operates on two parallel tracks:

### Technical Track

- <b>Build a verification pallet:</b> we are keeping the task open for Phase 2...and increasing the reward to 50'000 points! 
- <b>Integrate zkVerify:</b> you can either build a ZK dApp from scratch or integrate in your existing project. Use zkVerify for proof verification and get rewarded. Point reward depends on complexity. 
- <b>Send proofs for verification:</b> prove that your integration works and send proofs to zkVerify for rapid and cheap verification. More proofs sent = more points awarded. 

|  Challenge | Points  | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Build a verification pallet  |  50'000 | Active  |
| Integrate zkVerify  | Depends on complexity  | Active  |

### Community Track
Not a ZK developer? [Join zkVerify's campaign on Galxe](https://app.galxe.com/quest/QzaQxuvgdzSVXmvvcY5HHy/GCRCJtV8PN) and become part of our growing community! Complete engaging quests to learn about zero-knowledge proofs, share your knowledge, and help spread the word about zkVerify. Points are awarded for successful quests completion.

### A single source of truth
To track and measure your contributions, we have built a dedicated dApp, bringing together achievements from both technical and community tracks. Whether you're earning points through technical contributions or completing Galxe quests, all your progress syncs there â€“ your single source of truth for the Incentivized Testnet.

Track your standing on our comprehensive leaderboard, watch your points accumulate in real-time, and see how you stack up against other participants. Link: TBD

## Phase 1 - Build-to-Earn
Welcome to zkVerify's Incentivized Testnet - Phase 1. In this Phase, we have two exciting challenges for developers:

- <b>Build a verification pallet:</b> dive into the core of zkVerify by creating a crucial component for our Substrate-based chain. This task involves developing a pallet that efficiently handles the verification of zero-knowledge proofs.

- <b>Build a demo dApp:</b> showcase the practical applications of zkVerify by developing a demo dApp from scratch. This challenge encourages you to integrate zkVerify as a proof verification and settlement layer, bringing real-world use cases to life on our platform. One way to do this is take an existing dApp on GitHub, modify it to use zkVerify for its verification, and deploy it. Another way is to upgrade the dApp to use a newer type of zk-proof that can be generated on a mobile device rapidly, and create a mobile dApp.

|  Challenge | Points  | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Build a verification pallet  |  5000 | Updated (Phase 2)  |
| Build a demo app  | Variable  | Updated (Phase 2)  |
