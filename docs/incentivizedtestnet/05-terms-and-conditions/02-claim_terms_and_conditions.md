You are solely responsible for determining and fulfilling your own obligations with respect to any taxes (including without limitation income, capital gains, sales, use, value-added, or similar taxes) that may apply to your receipt, holding, transfer, or use of Tokens as part of the Claims Process or otherwise. Horizen does not provide tax, legal, or accounting advice, and nothing in these Terms should be construed as such.
