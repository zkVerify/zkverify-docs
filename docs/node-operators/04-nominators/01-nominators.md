If you're exploring staking on zkVerify, you'll encounter two main roles: validators and nominators. Nominators allow anyone to support the network without running a node, simply by delegating stake to reliable validators. Here's everything you need to know before getting started.


zkVerify is a blockchain developed with the Substrate framework and operates with the Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS) consensus model. This system relies on two complementary participants:

1. **Validators** run the validator software, participate in block production, verify proofs, and earn rewards.
2. **Nominators** delegate their VFY to a group of trusted validators and receive a portion of the rewards those validators earn. They do not need to run any infrastructure.
   - This role is equivalent to “delegator” on many Proof-of-Stake networks, but Substrate and Polkadot use “nominator.”
