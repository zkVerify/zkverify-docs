### What does staking VFY mean?

Staking VFY means you lock your tokens to support the zkVerify network. In return, you earn a share of the rewards generated by the validators you choose.

### What is a nominator?

By putting your VFY at stake, you become a nominator. You delegate your VFY to trusted validators, keep full ownership of your funds, and share in the validators’ rewards—all without running any software.

### Is “nominator” the same as “delegator”?

Yes. Other Proof-of-Stake networks tend to say “delegator.” zkVerify follows Polkadot’s NPoS model and uses “nominator.”

### What do validators do?

Validators run specialized infrastructure, produce blocks, verify proofs, and keep the network secure. Because they do the heavy lifting, they earn rewards that are shared with their nominators.

### How do I start staking?

Use either SubWallet (simpler UX) or PolkadotJS (advanced interface). See the “How to stake VFY as a nominator?” guide in this section for full details.

### Is there a minimum stake?

Yes. You must bond **at least 10 VFY** to become a nominator. You can check the live value through `Developer → Chain State → staking → minNominatorBond`.

### How many validators should I choose?

Most nominators pick multiple validators to reduce risk and improve the chance of being in the active set. You can adjust nominations at any time.

### How do I choose validators?

Look for validators with:

- Consistent uptime and performance  
- A solid reputation and community presence  
- No slashing history  
- Transparent communication  

### Can I lose my staked VFY?

Yes, if a validator you back gets slashed for malicious or negligent behavior. Always nominate validators you trust.

### Where do rewards get paid?

You choose a reward destination when bonding. You can send rewards to the same staking account, another wallet, or a stash/controller pair.

### Can I change validators later?

Yes. Update nominations in SubWallet or PolkadotJS any time—no need to unbond.

### Can I un-stake whenever I want?

You can start unbonding at any time, but there is a **7-day unbonding period** before the tokens become liquid again.

### Do I need special hardware?

No. Only validators run infrastructure. Nominators interact through wallets like SubWallet or the PolkadotJS UI.

### Is staking the same as locking tokens?

Yes. While staked, tokens are locked and cannot be transferred. Once you unbond and the waiting period ends, the tokens are free to move again.

### What does staking VFY mean?

Staking VFY means you lock your tokens to support the zkVerify network. In return, you earn a share of the rewards generated by the validators you choose.

### What is a Nominator?

By putting your VFY at stake, you become a nominator. A Nominator is someone who stakes VFY and delegates it to trusted Validators. You don’t run any software. You simply pick Validators, stake your tokens, and earn a portion of their rewards.

### Is “nominator” the same as “delegator”?

Yes, in practice. Other Proof-of-Stake networks use the word “delegator.” zkVerify uses “nominator” because it follows Polkadot’s Nominated Proof-of-Stake model.

### What do Validators do?

Validators run specialized software, produce blocks, verify proofs, and keep the network secure. Since they do the heavy lifting, they earn rewards that get shared with the nominators who support them.

### How do I start staking my VFY?

You can stake VFY using two options: SubWallet or PolkadotJS.

### Option 1: Staking with SubWallet (Recommended for most users)

If you want the simplest retail-friendly experience, SubWallet is the easiest way to get started. Everything can be done directly from the browser extension.

[SubWallet has a full step-by-step guide that walks you through:](https://docs.subwallet.app/main/extension-user-guide/earning/direct-nomination/start-staking)

* How to choose a validator  
* How to stake your tokens  
* How to monitor your rewards

We recommend following their guide for the smoothest flow.

### Option 2: Staking with PolkadotJS (Advanced interface)

You’ll use **PolkadotJS**, the standard interface for Substrate-based chains like zkVerify.

1. Go to **PolkadotJS → Network → Staking → Accounts**
2. Click **+ Nominator**
3. Choose the account you want to stake from
4. Enter how much VFY you want to stake and where rewards should go
5. Select the Validators you want to support
6. Click **Bond & Nominate**, then **Sign & Submit**

That’s it.

### Is there a minimum amount required to stake?

Yes. You must stake **at least 10 VFY** to become a nominator.

If you want to double-check, you can look up the current minimum by going to:  

**Developer → Chain State → staking → minNominatorBond → +**

### How many Validators should I choose?

You can select multiple Validators. Most nominators pick several to spread risk and improve their chances of earning rewards.

### How do I know which Validators to pick?

Choose Validators you trust. Look for:

* Good performance and uptime
* A reliable track record
* Clear communication with the community
* No history of slashing

Your rewards depend on the Validators you select.

### Can I lose my staked VFY?

Yes, but only if the Validators you nominate get slashed for poor behavior or malicious activity. This is why choosing trustworthy Validators is important.

### Where do my staking rewards go?

You choose your reward destination when setting up staking. You can send rewards to:

* The same staking wallet
* A different wallet
* A stash or controller account setup (if you’re following Polkadot-style setups)

### Can I change my Validators later?

Yes. You can update your nominations at any time in PolkadotJS without needing to unstake.

### Can I un-stake anytime I want?

Yes, but there is an unbonding period of 7 days before your tokens become liquid again.

### Do I need special hardware or software?

No. Only Validators need to run software. Nominators just use PolkadotJS or a different staking option.

### Is staking the same as locking up my tokens?

Yes. While your VFY is staked, it cannot be moved. Once you unbond, you’ll wait through the unbonding period, then your tokens become available again.
